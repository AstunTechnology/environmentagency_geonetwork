		<h1>How to add metadata</h1>
		<p>If you want to add a record to name of solution please email open@defra.gsi.gov.uk

		<h1>Sharing metadata records</h1>
		<p>Records can be saved and exported and links emailed and book-marked.<br/>
		Note – these records contain personal information. Please do not share externally.</p>
		<br/>
		<a name="8"/>
		<h1>Exporting records</h1>
		<p>This functionality is for when you want to share or re-use a metadata record with others.

		This can be done in numerous ways:
		<ul>
				<li>Save the file as ISO 19139 xml</li>
				<li>Save the file as DublinCore xml</li>
				<li>Save the record as a pdf</li>
			</ul>
		These can be done as individual records or by selecting many.<br/>
		Select the record(s) you want to save and in ‘actions on selection’ choose one of the options.</p>

		<h1>Emailing the metadata link</h1>
		<p>This functionality allows you to send an email with the metadata records unique ID. Click the envelope icon (top left).</p>
		<br/>
		<a name="10"/>
		<h1>Permanent link to the record</h1>
		<p>This functionality shows the metadata records full URL which includes the unique ID. Click the star icon (top left).</p>
		<br/>
		<a name="11"/>
		<h1>Deleting records</h1>
		<p>Metadata records must not be deleted. We keep all records for historic purposes.
		There is the functionality for administrators to retire records but these would need good reason - define what this is or link to process/guidance.</p>
